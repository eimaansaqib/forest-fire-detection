In this paper, we discuss advancements in deep learning for forest fire detection. We present a comprehensive survey of diverse annotated datasets suitable for training and evaluating deep learning models. Datasets are categorized into object detection and segmentation groups, with detailed descriptions of their characteristics and annotations. We evaluated various deep learning segmentation models for forest fire detection tasks, exploring the impact of different backbones, parameters and architectures. Our study highlights the potential of transformer-based architectures in improving these tasks compared to classical deep learning techniques. Despite limitations imposed by the moderately sized and biased dataset (FLAME), our findings have significant implications for both forest fire detection and computer vision fields.
